# Memory Game

A memory matching game built with vanilla HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.

## Motivation

Lacking portfolio projects built with only HTML, CSS, & JavaScript, I decided to create a fun, interactive game to showcase this skillset. This app provides difficulty options that switch up the card styles as well as feedback for correct and incorrect guesses.
